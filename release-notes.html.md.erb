### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.1.7:

* **[Bug Identified]** Metrics emitted by PCF Healthwatch are not tagged with the Foundation name while being emitted back into the Firehose. This is resolved in v1.1.9. 
* **[Bug Identified]** Where two-factor authentication is enabled for the BOSH Director, the BOSH Health Check continuous validation test and the BOSH Task Check may not work correctly. This manifests as the BOSH Health panel showing as red even through the Director is healthy.
* Due to a [known metric emission issue](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#uaa-request-latency) with PCF, the `Request Latency by UAA` chart will be blank on the UAA details page.

   * Query Rate
   * MySQL CPU Busy Time
   * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='v1.1.6'></a>v1.1.6
**Release Date: March 20, 2018**

### Release Notes
* To support PCF Healthwatch v1.1 running on either PCF v2.0 or PCF v2.1, the Firehose Loss Rate calculation has been updated to adjust for the underlying source metric differences between PCF v2.0 and PCF v2.1. 
* **[Bug Fix]** The newest version of the Chrome browser (v65.0.3325.162) will cause several charts on Healthwatch to display alert banding even when no threshold has been breached. This is due to a change in how Chrome handles SVG. v1.1.6 resolves this potential UI issue on newer Chrome browser versions.
* The UAA details page is now also compatible with the [PCF Small Footprint PAS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) tile.

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.1.6:

* **[Bug Identified]** Metrics emitted by PCF Healthwatch are not tagged with the Foundation name while being emitted back into the Firehose. This is resolved in v1.1.9. 
* **[Bug Identified]** Where two-factor authentication is enabled for the BOSH Director, the BOSH Health Check continuous validation test and the BOSH Task Check may not work correctly. This manifests as the BOSH Health panel showing as red even through the Director is healthy.
* Due to a [known metric emission issue](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#uaa-request-latency) with PCF, the `Request Latency by UAA` chart will be blank on the UAA details page. 
* Does not cover monitoring of [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/isolation-segments.html).
* If using PCF Healthwatch v1.1 on PCF v2.1, the `Number of Route Registration Messages Sent and Received` comparison graph may incorrectly reflect an inflated gap. 
* Hides three of the [PAS MySQL KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#kpi4MySQL) charts. These charts will be available in a future patch version:
   * Query Rate
   * MySQL CPU Busy Time
   * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='v1.1.5'></a>v1.1.5
**Release Date: March 5, 2018**

### Release Notes
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes a bug identified in v1.1.4 where the new java-based `Push Monitoring Components for PCF Healthwatch` errand could fail in some environments leveraging self-signed certs. 
* **[Bug Fix]** Improves the performance of the Ingestor component (firehose nozzle). On some environments the Ingestors would experience high CPU and disconnect repeatedly from the firehose, risking loss of firehose-based data in Healthwatch. 
    * As a result of this effort, the Ingestor and Loader have been combined and are no longer separate components. As of v1.1.5, the Ingestor now feeds directly to the datastore. These combined components still report on themselves in the same manner for [product monitoring](monitoring.html#keyPerformanceIndicators).
* **[Bug Fix]** Product [created metrics](metrics.html) that result from assessments of firehose-based metric data were not properly accounting for a null scenario resulting from a complete loss of firehose data. These metrics would still attempt to calculate and publish, resulting in a produced `0` value. A `0` value would indicate an issue for most produced metrics. However in the case of the logging Loss Rate metrics where a `0` value is healthy, this issue could have hidden an underlying metric feed problem. As of v1.1.5, given that the values needed to make a necessary metric assessment are not present, then the related Healthwatch produced metric will not be calculated or published, until the platform data flow is restored. For external metric consumers, a stop in production of these metrics therefore indicates a potential issue with Healthwatch itself.
    * Current Healthwatch metrics resulting from firehose data: Firehose Loss Rate, Adapter Loss Rate, Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate, Syslog Drain Binding Capacity, Number of Available Free Chunks of Memory, Percentage of Memory Available, Total Memory Available, Percentage of Disk Available, Total Disk Available, Percentage of Cell Container Capacity Available, Total Cell Container Capacity Available
* **[Feature]** A new page is now available that visualizes the recently recommended [UAA KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/monitoring/kpi.html#uaa) recommendations for PCF 2.0. It is available at `healthwatch.<system>/uaa/details`

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.1.5:

* **[Bug Identified]** Metrics emitted by PCF Healthwatch are not tagged with the Foundation name while being emitted back into the Firehose. This is resolved in v1.1.9. 
* **[Bug Identified]** Where two-factor authentication is enabled for the BOSH Director, the BOSH Health Check continuous validation test and the BOSH Task Check may not work correctly. This manifests as the BOSH Health panel showing as red even through the Director is healthy.
* UAA details page is not compatible with the [PCF Small Footprint PAS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) tile. 
* Due to a [known metric emission issue](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#uaa-request-latency) with PCF, the `Request Latency by UAA` chart will be blank on the UAA details page. 
* Does not cover monitoring of [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/isolation-segments.html).
* If using PCF Healthwatch v1.1 on PCF v2.1, the `Number of Route Registration Messages Sent and Received` comparison graph may incorrectly reflect an inflated gap. 
* Hides three of the [PAS MySQL KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#kpi4MySQL) charts. These charts will be available in a future patch version:
    * Query Rate
    * MySQL CPU Busy Time
    * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='v1.1.4'></a>v1.1.4
**Release Date: February 8, 2018**

### Release Notes
* **[Bug Fix]** Switches the servlet container from Tomcat to Jetty. This resolves reported issues with Healthwatch installation failing on a non-RFC 1918 network.
* **[Bug Fix]** Switches the underlying push-apps errand script from bash script to kotlin. This is expected to resolve issues on some Azure installations where the CLI was timing out before the Healthwatch push-apps errand could complete successfully.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes an issue identified in v1.1.3 where the Logging Throughput and Loss Rate calculations were potentially underreporting.
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes an issue identified in v1.1.3 and earlier where the CF CLI credentials were visible in the `push_apps` script logs.
* **[Bug Fix]** The CLI Command Health Check app was not declaring the amount of memory available to it, therefore relying on the system default. In some environments this could result in too low of memory available to successfully start the app. Other packaged test apps did already declare memory needed. To resolve, the CLI Command Health Check app now explicitly declares a 1GB memory allocation on push.  
* **[Feature]** The existing manifest capability to [Disable Ops Manager Continuous Validation Testing](installing.html#healthwatch-opsman) has been exposed as a configuration property within the Ops Manager UI for the Healthwatch tile configuration. This [enable/disable](installing.html#healthwatch-opsman) choice is available on the Health Check configuration screen within the Healthwatch tile settings screen. The default value is `Enable`.
    * **Note**: If you had previously turned this test off within the manifest prior to v1.1.4, please validate your setting is `Disable` before applying changes to upgrade to this release version.
* **[Feature]** Healthwatch now creates and publishes 3 additional metrics regarding [Capacity Available](metrics.html#capacity). These are useful for downstream consumers wanting to monitor against a given available capacity value, instead of, or in compliment to, the percentage-based available capacity metrics already published.
    * [Total Memory Available](metrics.html#memory-total): `healthwatch.Diego.TotalAvailableMemoryCapacity.5M`
    * [Total Disk Available](metrics.html#disk-total):`healthwatch.Diego.TotalAvailableDiskCapacity.5M`
    * [Total Cell Container Capacity Available](metrics.html#cell-container-total): `healthwatch.Diego.TotalAvailableContainerCapacity.5M`
* **[Feature]** The main dashboard will now display the Foundation name. This displayed name will be the name [configured](installing.html#healthwatch-tile), or the system domain if this default value was not updated.
* **[Security Feature]** As Operators are allowed to define the name of the foundation, which is then published into the firehose as a tag on the Healthwatch emitted [metrics](metrics.html), a sanitization method has been added to [Metron Forwarder](architecture.html) so that disallowed characters that could be problematic for other downstream firehose consumers cannot be published. Any [disallowed](installing.html#healthwatch-tile) characters are stripped from the passed foundation label value.
* **[Feature]** UI Improvements:
    * The copy to clipboard user interaction was improved throughout the UI. Now `Copied` will display briefly when the copy icon is clicked. 
    * Minor design update made to the layout of the Jobs detail page in order to improve overall readability of the information presented.
    * On the Job Instances detail page, the y-axis is now fixed 0-100% for the bosh metric line graphs. This makes this page consistent with behavior on other product pages, and better emphasis low vs high percentages when scanning across multiple charts. 
    * On the test result detail pages for CLI Command Health, Canary App Health, BOSH Director Health, and Ops Manager Health, the end time for a particular test run is now displayed in the details table in UTC. By displaying this information-only timestamp in UTC, it is easier to leverage the information when searching through relevant logs. The primary UI interactions on these pages remains as-is, displaying in the user's local time.
    * On the test result detail pages for CLI Command Health, Canary App Health, BOSH Director Health, and Ops Manager Health, the detailed test result table has been visually adjusted so that the information no longer needs to be truncated, and is easier to read. Test Results are now represented by a Pass/Fail/Didn't Run/No Data icon, with a hover interaction available to confirm icon meaning.
    * Improvement made to queries updating the Capacity panel on the main dashboard. This panel could sometimes show an unexpected line drop in the final minute, although the details page already had the most recent value correctly displayed. This update reduces the likelihood of that behavior. 
    * We have removed the previously stated limitation that the Google Chrome browser must be used for accessing the UI. The latest Mozilla Firefox browser also works well. Microsoft Edge 16 has one issue with broken tab switch navigation on the Capacity and Diego detail pages that looks to be resolved in the upcoming Edge 17.

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.1.4:

* **[Bug Identified]** Metrics emitted by PCF Healthwatch are not tagged with the Foundation name while being emitted back into the Firehose. This is resolved in v1.1.9. 
* **[Bug Identified]** Where two-factor authentication is enabled for the BOSH Director, the BOSH Health Check continuous validation test and the BOSH Task Check may not work correctly. This manifests as the BOSH Health panel showing as red even through the Director is healthy.
* **[Bug Identified]** v1.1.4 introduced a new java-based `Push Monitoring Components for PCF Healthwatch` errand. This errand will not execute in an environment leveraging self-signed certs where the CA for these certs was added to the BOSH Director Trusted Certs via Ops Man in order to facilitate SSL validation. The resolution is to update the JVM's trust store with these certs. This is resolved in v1.1.5.
* Does not cover monitoring of [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/isolation-segments.html).
* Does not include the recently published [UAA KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/monitoring/kpi.html#uaa) recommendations for PCF 2.0
* If using PCF Healthwatch v1.1 on PCF v2.1, the `Number of Route Registration Messages Sent and Received` comparison graph may incorrectly reflect an inflated gap. 
* Hides three of the [PAS MySQL KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#kpi4MySQL) charts. These charts will be available in a future patch version:
    * Query Rate
    * MySQL CPU Busy Time
    * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='v1.1.3'></a>v1.1.3
**Release Date: January 11, 2018**

### Release Notes
* **[Feature]** PCF Healthwatch is now also compatible with the PCF Small Footprint PAS tile 
* **[Feature]** Operators can now choose to change the default Foundation name that PCF Healthwatch passes into the firehose as part of the publication of the [PCF Healthwatch Metrics](metrics.html).
    * Operators can optionally [configure](installing.html#healthwatch-tile) this name within the tile. Doing so will replace the default foundation name value of system domain. This updated foundation name is passed into the Firehose as a key-value tag. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    origin:"healthwatch" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1515598485276671703 deployment:"cf" job:"healthwatch-forwarder" index:"07a5b686-ef82-4dd0-6413-466b" ip:"10.0.16.6" tags:&lt;key:"foundation" value:"production-1" &gt; valueMetric:&lt;name:"SyslogDrain.Adapter.LossRate.1M" value:0 unit:"m" &gt;
    origin:"healthwatch" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1515598485279815606 deployment:"cf" job:"healthwatch-forwarder" index:"07a5b686-ef82-4dd0-6413-466b" ip:"10.0.16.6" tags:&lt;key:"foundation" value:"production-1" &gt; valueMetric:&lt;name:"SyslogDrain.RLP.LossRate.1M" value:0 unit:"m" &gt;
    </pre>
* **[Feature]** The error page is now more descriptive when the login error is the result of an invalid scope. 
    * Users that receive the error message `Error: User missing required scopes.` when attempting to access the PCF Healthwatch UI will need to have the correct `healthwatch.read` scope added to their UAA user account.
* **[Feature]** When using the copy+paste interaction on an unhealthy job, the job name will also now be copied to clipboard. Having `job/vm-id` in the clipboard provides more useful pasting into the bosh2 cli. 
* **[Bug Fix]** Fixes an issue identified in v1.1.1 where the full root ca certificate was visible in the log output 
* Product stemcell was updated to v3468

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.1.3:

* **[Bug Identified]** Metrics emitted by PCF Healthwatch are not tagged with the Foundation name while being emitted back into the Firehose. This is resolved in v1.1.9. 
* **[Bug Identified]** Where two-factor authentication is enabled for the BOSH Director, the BOSH Health Check continuous validation test and the BOSH Task Check may not work correctly. This manifests as the BOSH Health panel showing as red even through the Director is healthy.
* **[Bug Identified]** The CF CLI credentials are visible in the `push_apps` script logs. This is fixed in v1.1.4.
* **[Bug Identified]** An update to origin-based queries introduced in v1.1.3 caused a potential calculation issue to occur for the Logging Throughput and Logging Loss Rate calculations, as these can compute from multiple [metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#firehose-loss-rate) with differing origins. This is resolved in v1.1.4.
* Does not cover monitoring of [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/isolation-segments.html).
* Supports only the Google Chrome browser when accessing the PCF Healthwatch UI.
* If using PCF Healthwatch v1.1 on PCF v2.1, the `Number of Route Registration Messages Sent and Received` comparison graph may incorrectly reflect an inflated gap. 
* Hides three of the [PAS MySQL KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#kpi4MySQL) charts. These charts will be available in a future patch version:
    * Query Rate
    * MySQL CPU Busy Time
    * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='v1.1.1'></a>v1.1.1
**Release Date: December 22, 2017**

### Release Notes
* **[Feature]** To support monitoring of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.0, the following functionality has been added to PCF Healthwatch:
    * The [Number of Route Registration Messages Sent and Received](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#route-registration) indicator helps monitor the performance of the Gorouter.
    * The [Locks Held by BBS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#BBSActiveLocks) and [Locks Held by Auctioneer](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#AuctioneerActiveLocks) indicators help monitor the performance of Diego components.
* **[Feature]** Metrics published by PCF Healthwatch on a given PCF foundation are now identifiable to that foundation.
    * If PCF Healthwatch is installed on multiple foundations, the metrics PCF Healthwatch publishes are identifiable to their source PCF foundation. This enables operators who are aggregating data streams from multiple foundations to more easily recognize which foundation the PCF Healthwatch metrics of concern originated from.
    * By default, the value provided for a PCF foundation is the system domain of that foundation. The foundation value is passed into the Firehose as a key-value tag. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    origin:"healthwatch" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1511211281010702574 deployment:"cf" job:"healthwatch-forwarder" index:"dbf89280-1b6b-46c7-4255-aaad" ip:"10.0.16.29" tags:&lt;key:"foundation" value:"pcf.downey.cfapps.com" &gt; valueMetric:&lt;name:"health.check.OpsMan.probe.count" value:1 unit:"count" &gt;
    origin:"healthwatch" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1511211286171879726 deployment:"cf" job:"healthwatch-forwarder" index:"05a557a0-0e38-4298-6adb-278d" ip:"10.0.16.29" tags:&lt;key:"foundation" value:"pcf.downey.cfapps.com" &gt; valueMetric:&lt;name:"health.check.bosh.director.probe.available" value:1 unit:"Metric" &gt;
    </pre>
* **[Feature]** PCF Healthwatch now publishes operational metrics about itself so that its functionality and performance can also be monitored.
    * Scaling indicators: [healthwatch.ingestor.disconnects](monitoring.html#firehose-disconnect) and [healthwatch.loader.dropped](monitoring.html#loader-dropped)
    * Test availability: [health.check.cliCommand.probe.available](monitoring.html#cli-test-availability), [health.check.CanaryApp.probe.available](monitoring.html#canary-test-availability), [health.check.bosh.director.probe.available](monitoring.html#bosh-test-availability), and [health.check.OpsMan.probe.available](monitoring.html#opsman-test-availability)
    * Underlying computation: [healthwatch.metrics.published](monitoring.html#super-metrics-published), [health.check.cliCommand.probe.count](monitoring.html#cli-command-health-probe), [health.check.OpsMan.probe.count](monitoring.html#opsmanager-health-probe), [health.check.CanaryApp.probe.count](monitoring.html#canary-health-probe), and [health.check.bosh.director.probe.count](monitoring.html#bosh-health-probe)
    * PCF Healthwatch UI availability: [healthwatch.ui.available](monitoring.html#ui-availability)

    For more information, see [Monitoring PCF Healthwatch](monitoring.html).

* **[Feature]** Operators installing or upgrading PCF Healthwatch can now configure the desired number of Health Checkers in the Healthwatch Component Config section of the PCF Healthwatch tile.
* **[Feature]** Operators who do not use Ops Manager for deployments can now turn off the default Ops Manager test suite. For more information, see [Installing and Configuring PCF Healthwatch](installing.html#healthwatch-opsman).
* **[Feature]** UI Improvements:
    * The PCF Healthwatch dashboard has a new six-column default layout. If the width of your display is 1835 pixels or fewer, the dashboard shows three columns; you can resize them manually in the browser.
    * When an unhealthy job is flagged and becomes visible on the PCF Healthwatch dashboard, you can now click on that job name to go directly to the Job Instances Detail page for that specific job.    
    * Tooltip interactions and handling of long deployment names was improved.
    * Breadcrumb navigation was added.
    * Panel titles now link to detail view pages.

    * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='whatsnew'></a>What's New in PCF Healthwatch v1.1

PCF Healthwatch v1.0 was available as a limited, closed-BETA release. The section below summarizes key differences between PCF Healthwatch v1.0 and v1.1. For more information about new features in v1.1, see [v1.1.0 release notes](release-notes.html#v1.1.1).

### Key Differences
* **[Feature]** Manual plugin configurations are no longer required to ingest BOSH metrics into PCF Healthwatch. Use of the prior plugins should be eliminated upon switch to v1.1.
    * Smoke tests now fail on lack of BOSH metrics.
* **Naming convention changes**:
    * The `healthwatch.health.check.AppsMan.available` metric is now `healthwatch.health.check.CanaryApp.available`.
    * The `healthwatch.health.check.AppsMan.responseTime` metric is now `healthwatch.health.check.CanaryApp.responseTime`.
    * The data loader app deployed at installation was renamed from `mysql-logqueue` to `loader`.
* **Data convention change**: In PCF Healthwatch v1.0, the default deployment value for all [Healthwatch-created metrics](metrics.html) was `p-healthwatch`. In PCF Healthwatch v1.1, the deployment value is the actual deployment value the metrics were created from. This is a necessary data structure change to prepare for the future capability of monitoring isolation segments. The origin of all Healthwatch-created metrics remains `healthwatch`.
* **Default installation configuration change**: 
    * Ingestor instance count now defaults to 4
    * MySQL Loader instance count now defaults to 4
* **[Feature]** New [Syslog Drain Binding Capacity](metrics.html#syslog-drain-binding-capacity) metric represents the average number of drain bindings across Adapter instances. The Logging Performance page now displays this capacity ratio as an indicator for scaling Syslog Drain Adapters. This chart replaces the informational Count of Bindings chart used in v1.0. 
* **[Feature]** The following Router graphs are now multi-line so that the performance of the individual instances can be better represented:
    * Router Throughput
    * 502 Bad Gateways 
    * All 5XX Errors
    * Number of Routes Registered 
* **[Feature]** New count of the [Available Free Chunks](metrics.html#free-memory-chunks) metric is now available within the PCF Healthwatch datastore and is being forwarded into the Firehose for external consumption.
